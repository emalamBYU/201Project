            <h2>How It All Started</h2>
            <p>
                I began learning to type as a way to improve my productivity and communication skills. 
                At first, I struggled to find the right keys without looking, but with daily practice, my accuracy began to improve.

            <h2>Progress Over Time</h2>
            <p>
                Through consistent practice sessions and using online typing tools, 
                my speed has gone from a slow 25 words per minute to over 60 words per minute, and still climbing!

            <h2>What's Next</h2>
            <p>
                My next goal is to reach 80+ words per minute with 100% accuracy, and eventually be able to type effortlessly 
                while focusing entirely on my thoughts instead of the keyboard.
