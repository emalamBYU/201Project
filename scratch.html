            <h2>How It All Started</h2>
            <p>
                I began learning to type as a way to improve my productivity and communication skills. 
                At first, I struggled to find the right keys without looking, but with daily practice, my accuracy began to improve.

            <h2>Progress Over Time</h2>
            <p>
                Through consistent practice sessions and using online typing tools, 
                my speed has gone from a slow 25 words per minute to over 60 words per minute, and still climbing!

            <h2>What's Next</h2>
            <p>
                My next objective is to achieve a peak typing speed of 200 words per minute and to consistently maintain an average speed between 160 and 180 words per minute.
