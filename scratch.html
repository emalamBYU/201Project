            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>
                When I first started learning to type, I could barely reach 20 words per minute.
                My fingers stumbled over the keys, and I had to keep looking down at the keyboard.

            <h2>Building Speed</h2>
            <p>
                Through consistent practice, my typing speed started to improve.  
                I began to trust muscle memory, and my eyes stayed focused on the screen instead of the keys.

            <h2>Reaching New Goals</h2>
            <p>
                Now, I can type over 80 words per minute with accuracy.  
                Itâ€™s satisfying to see how dedication and repetition can lead to real progress.
